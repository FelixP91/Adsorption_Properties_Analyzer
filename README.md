# Biochemical_Analyzer

This code takes a FASTA file containing protein seqeunces and pdb files (generated by AlphaFold) as input and returns a DataFrame with biochemical properties of the respective proteins. 
Calculated features: 

- isoelectric point
- molecular mass
- net charge at pH 5,7,9
- surface charge at pH 5,7,9
- area of tha largest connected patch of charged (at pH 7) amino acids
- area of tha largest connected patch of hydrophobic amino acids
