# Biochemical_Analyzer

This code takes a FASTA file containing protein seqeunces and pdb files (generated by AlphaFold) as input and returns a DataFrame (as .csv file) with biochemical properties of the respective proteins. 
Calculated features: 

- isoelectric point
- net charge (at pH 5,7,9 or user defined)
- surface charge (at pH 5,7,9 or user defined)
- area of tha largest connected patch of charged (at pH 7 or user defined) amino acids
- area of tha largest connected patch of hydrophobic amino acids
- relative hydrophobic surface area
- relative charged surface area
